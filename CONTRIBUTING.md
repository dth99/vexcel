## Coding Guidelines

### Go Style

- Follow [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)
- Run `go fmt` before committing
- Run `go vet` to catch common mistakes
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for exported functions

### Code Organization

- Keep functions small and focused
- Separate concerns (UI, logic, data)
- Use interfaces for testability
- Handle errors explicitly

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run with race detector
go test -race ./...
```

### Commit Messages

Follow the conventional commits specification:

```
feat: add new theme
fix: resolve search crash
docs: update README
style: format code
refactor: reorganize UI package
test: add loader tests
chore: update dependencies
```

## Areas for Contribution

### Good First Issues

- Documentation improvements
- Adding new themes
- UI polish and refinements
- Performance optimizations
- Test coverage

### Feature Ideas

- Column resizing
- Cell editing
- Filter capabilities
- Custom keybindings
- Configuration file support
- Chart visualization
- Diff mode

## Testing Your Changes

1. Test with various file formats (.xlsx, .csv)
2. Test with large files (50k+ rows)
3. Test all themes
4. Test all keyboard shortcuts
5. Test on different terminals (iTerm, Terminal.app, alacritty, etc.)
6. Test on different OS (macOS, Linux, Windows)

## Documentation

When adding new features:

1. Update README.md
2. Add examples
3. Update keyboard shortcuts section
4. Add inline code comments
5. Consider adding a tutorial

## Performance Considerations

- Use lazy loading for large files
- Minimize allocations in hot paths
- Profile before optimizing
- Consider memory usage for large datasets
